# Welcome to Carmenâ€™s Projects

Hi! I'm Dr. Carmen White â€” a Speech-Language Pathologist, Data Science learner, and creator. This space is where I document my journey, showcase my projects, and build boldly in public.

## ðŸŒŸ Featured Project

### [Excursion: App Landing Page](https://dr-carmenwhite.github.io/Excursion/)
A responsive landing page created for a fictional travel app as part of a web development course. This project helped me strengthen my HTML and CSS skills while learning how to structure responsive layouts. Hosted on GitHub Pages.
